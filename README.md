## Troubleshooting & Debugging

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. **No vulnerabilities found but expecting some**
**Symptoms**: Scan completes successfully but reports 0 vulnerabilities despite known issues

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Verify dependency files are in the specified scan directory
- ✅ Check OSV Scanner version compatibility with your dependency formats
- ✅ Ensure internet connectivity for vulnerability database access
- ✅ Confirm dependency files are not ignored by `.gitignore`
- ✅ Try running OSV Scanner locally: `osv-scanner --format json .`

#### 2. **Slack notifications not working**
**Symptoms**: Workflow runs successfully but no Slack messages appear

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Verify webhook URL format: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/...`
- ✅ Check bot token starts with `xoxb-`
- ✅ Ensure bot has `chat:write` and `files:write` permissions
- ✅ Verify channel name format: `#security` (with #)
- ✅ Test webhook manually: `curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"text":"Test"}' YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL`

#### 3. **PR not being blocked despite vulnerabilities**
**Symptoms**: High/critical vulnerabilities found but PR can still be merged

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Check `fail_on_vulnerabilities: true` is set
- ✅ Verify severity threshold allows blocking (not set to 'critical' when finding 'high')
- ✅ Confirm branch protection rules require status checks
- ✅ Review GitHub Actions status in PR - should show ❌ if blocking

#### 4. **Workflow fails on dependency parsing**
**Symptoms**: OSV Scanner errors or parsing failures

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Ensure dependency files are valid (run package manager locally)
- ✅ Check for unsupported dependency file formats
- ✅ Try scanning specific directories: `scan_directory: './src'`
- ✅ Use custom dependency paths for complex project structures

#### 5. **File upload to Slack fails**
**Symptoms**: Notifications work but HTML reports don't upload

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Verify bot token has `files:write` scope
- ✅ Check file size limits (Slack has 1GB limit)
- ✅ Ensure bot is added to the target channel
- ✅ Try disabling uploads temporarily: `upload_reports: false`

### Debug Mode & Logging

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```yaml
jobs:
  security-scan:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/osv-scanner.yml
    with:
      # ... other config
      debug_mode: true  # Enable verbose logging
```

### Testing Your Configuration

#### Local Testing
```bash
# Test OSV Scanner locally
osv-scanner --format json . > test-results.json

# Test Slack webhook
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"text":"Test from OSV Scanner workflow"}' \
  YOUR_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
```

#### Workflow Testing
```yaml
# Test workflow with minimal configuration
jobs:
  test-scan:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/osv-scanner.yml
with:
      scan_type: 'dependencies-only'
      fail_on_vulnerabilities: false
      slack_enabled: false  # Disable for testing

## Best Practices & Recommendations

### **Getting Started**
1. **Start with Warning Mode**: Set `fail_on_vulnerabilities: false` initially
2. **Test Configuration**: Run manual scans before enabling PR blocking
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Begin with high/critical severity thresholds
4. **Monitor Results**: Review initial scan results and adjust thresholds

### **Configuration Optimization**
1. **Severity Thresholds**: 
   - Production: `critical` or `high`
   - Staging: `high` or `medium`
   - Development: `medium` or `low`

2. **Scan Frequency**:
   - Critical projects: Daily scans
   - Standard projects: Weekly scans
   - Legacy projects: Monthly scans

3. **Channel Strategy**:
   - `#security-critical`: Critical/high severity alerts
   - `#security-general`: All vulnerability reports
   - `#compliance`: Monthly compliance reports

### **Security Considerations**
1. **Secrets Management**: Store all credentials in GitHub Secrets
2. **Branch Protection**: Require status checks for critical branches
3. **Audit Trails**: Enable GitHub Actions logging for compliance
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep OSV Scanner version updated
5. **Backup Strategy**: Download and archive critical scan results

### **Monitoring & Maintenance**
1. **Track Metrics**: Monitor scan frequency and vulnerability trends
2. **Review Thresholds**: Adjust severity levels based on team capacity
3. **Update Dependencies**: Regular maintenance of dependency files
4. **Team Training**: Ensure team understands workflow outputs and actions

## Advanced Integrations
